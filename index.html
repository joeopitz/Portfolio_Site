        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>My name is Joe Opitz, and I am a junior on the golf team at Montaba Technological University. I am majoring in Data Science with minors in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. My interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence grew after realizing their potential to drive innovation, a passion further solidified through Montana Tech's machine learning class and related projects, such as applying Machine Learning to March Madness predictions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through golf, I have honed my communication skills, learning to engage effectively with a wide range of individuals. Spending 4-5 hours on the course with diverse players has significantly enhanced my ability to converse and collaborate in various settings.</p>

            <h3>Predicting March Madness</h3>
            <p>Developed a Machine Learning model to automate March Madness bracket predictions, combining data visualization, feature engineering, and ensemble methods. Learned and applied advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, enhancing model accuracy and understanding of ML workflows.</p>

            <h3>SVD Based Approximation in Image Compression</h3>
            <p>Collaborated to compress images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), demonstrating how low-rank approximations retain essential features while reducing data size for grayscale and RGB images. Documented findings in a detailed LaTeX report.</p>
